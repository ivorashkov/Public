My name is ... and I've been working in Application Management for over 3 years.
My previous experience is related to ERP Software, Transactions, Debugging, reading logs, reporting and 
if the issue could be resolved from my side also fixing.
More specifically I've been working also with certificates, different kind of communication protocols
testing connectivity, running specific scripts or connecting with different team members from other departments
to resolve or forward the issue with enough information so they can easily do their job.
The OSes I've been working on are Windows and Linux based systems, through RDP(remote desctop protocol) or 
in other cases SSH based interface.
My technical knowledge is based on my previous experience plus courses that I am participating in 
during my weekends/free afterwork time such as Java Programming Courses in the past year and a half and soon I will be 
taking Cloud/Linux/Docker and Containerisation course so I can improve even further.

In conclusion about my self I am proactive learner, I can learn fast, also multitask and 
also want to become valuable employee that everyone can rely on.
