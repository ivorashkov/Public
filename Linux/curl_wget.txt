curl, curl [options] [URL...]
cURL, which stands for client URL, is a command line tool that developers 
use to transfer data to and from a server. At the most fundamental, 
cURL lets you talk to a server by specifying the location (in the form of a URL)
and the data you want to send.

curl -o [file_name] [URL...] / curl -o hello.zip ftp://speedtest.tele2.net/1MB.zip
-o: saves the downloaded file on the local machine with the name provided in the parameters. 
-O: This option downloads the file and saves it with the same name as in the URL. 
-C -: This option resumes download which has been stopped due to some reason. 
This is useful when downloading large files and was interrupted. 
curl -C - -O ftp://speedtest.tele2.net/1MB.zip
curl --limit-rate [value] [URL]
curl --limit-rate 1000K -O ftp://speedtest.tele2.net/1MB.zip
-u: curl also provides options to download files from user authenticated FTP servers. 
curl -u {username}:{password} [FTP_URL] / curl -u demo:password -O ftp://test.rebex.net/readme.txt
-T: This option helps to upload a file to the FTP server. 
curl -u {username}:{password} -T {filename} {FTP_Location}
curl [URL...] --libcurl [filename] #  If this option is appended to any cURL command, 
it outputs the C source code that uses libcurl for the specified option.
-x, –proxy: curl also lets us use a proxy to access the URL. 
curl -x [proxy_name]:[port] [URL...]
* If the proxy requires authentication, it can be used with the command: 
curl -u [user]:[password] -x [proxy_name]:[port] [URL...]
